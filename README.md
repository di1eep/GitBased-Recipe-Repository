## Why Git-Based?

Traditional recipe-sharing platforms lack transparency, easy collaboration, and version control. By leveraging the capabilities of Git and GitHub, this repository aims to fill that gap by offering:

- Transparency through complete change tracking.
- Easy collaboration with features like forks, branches, and pull requests.
- Robust version control to maintain the quality and integrity of each recipe.
